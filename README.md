# v1 engine

**v1 engine** is a work-in-progress game engine built entirely from scratch using C++. This project is a collaborative effort between friends with a passion for low-level systems, graphics programming, and game development. Our goal is to build a lightweight, flexible engine with our own custom rendering pipeline and architecture.

## 🚀 Project Vision

We’re not using Unity. We’re not using Unreal. We’re going deep — building everything from the ground up.

- ✅ Custom rendering pipeline (no external engines)
- ✅ C++ core for performance and control
- 🛠️ Low-level graphics (OpenGL/Vulkan/DirectX — TBD)
- 🔧 Asset pipeline and editor tools (in future)
- 🎮 Real-time game simulation and logic systems

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Graphics API:** TBD (likely OpenGL/Vulkan for starters)
- **Build System:** CMake (cross-platform support)
- **Dev Environment:** Linux & Windows (multi-platform support planned)
